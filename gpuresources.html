    <p>There are two high performance compute clusters with GPUs.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="HPC-non-sensitive-data.html">
	   Duke Compute Cluster (DCC)</a></h3>
	<ul>
	  <li> Contains multiple GPUs, including
	   A6000's and A5000's. </li>
	   <li>Some of these are on the "scavenger partition",
	   which is a <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com" target="_blank">Slurm partition</a>
	   for PI-owned nodes that are available to
	   other users willing to be evicted when the owner wants to use the node.</li>
	   <li>PI-owned GPU nodes can be added provided they are compatible with the DCC's requirements
	   regarding operating system, power usage, form factor, etc. Contact </li>
	   <li>For additional help and advice regarding GPUs in DCC
	   <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/ResearchComputing@ProdDuke.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/"

	<h3><a href="HPC-sensitive-data.html">School of Medicine HPC Cluster</a></h3>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>
	  Has a single GPU node with 4 NVIDIA L40S GPUs plus 64 CPU cores and 1 TB RAM.
      <li>As of June 2024 the cost was $3.50 / GPU-hour.</li>
      <li>	  The L40S GPUs have smaller memory
	  than A100's, but may have faster processing.</li> 

	  <li>It may be possible for PIs to
	  purchase additional GPU nodes and house them in this HPC cluster. Please contact
