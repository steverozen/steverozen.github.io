	<p>The <a href="https://oit.duke.edu/" target="_blank">
	Duke Office of Information Technology (OIT)</a> provides a high-permance computing (HPC)
	   cluster called DCC (Duke Compute Cluster, <a href="https://bit.ly/oit-dcc">
	   https://bit.ly/oit-dcc</a>).
    </p>
	<ul>
	<li>
	DCC runs Alma Linux and <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com">the Slurm scheduler</a>.
	Two Slum partitions are free to use. In addition, labs can add 
	their own nodes (provided they are compatible with the cluster)
	and always get priority access on their node. Other labs can 
	use the node but are evicted immediately if the owner wants to use the node
	</li>
	<li>
	DCC provides most bioinformatics software packages using the “Environment Modules” 
	system (https://modules.sourceforge.net), and other standard packages can 
	usually be added to the module system on request.
    </li>
	<li>
	PIs can arrange with OIT to add their own nodes to DCC. 
	Computing can also be reserved at $85 / core-year. 
	Additional pricing at <a href="https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0030661">
	https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0030661</a>.

	<li>DCC offers the “OPEN OnDemand” web-browser interface 
	(<a href="https://openondemand.org">https://openondemand.org</a>).
	 This provides a Linux desktop plus RStudio, 
	 JupyterLab notebooks, and VS Code.</li>

	<li>Data storage: 1 TB free storage per lab, 
	additional storage available for rent. Archival storage is $62 / TB-year 
	without backup and $144 / TB-year with backup. 
	Additional pricing for higher speed storage is at
