    "text": "DCC - Duke Compute Cluster\nThe Duke Office of Information Technology (OIT) provides a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster called DCC (Duke Compute Cluster, https://bit.ly/oit-dcc){target=“blank”}.\n\nDCC runs AlmaLinux and the Slurm scheduler. Two Slurm partitions are free to use. In addition, labs can add their own nodes (provided they are compatible with the cluster) and always get priority access on their node. Other labs can use the node but are evicted immediately if the owner wants to use the node.\nDCC provides most bioinformatics software packages using the “Environment Modules” system (https://modules.sourceforge.net), and other standard packages can usually be added to the module system on request.\nPIs can arrange with OIT to add their own nodes to DCC. Computing can also be reserved at $85 / core-year. Additional pricing at https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0030661/.\nDCC offers the “Open OnDemand” web-browser interface (https://openondemand.org). This provides a Linux desktop plus RStudio, JupyterLab notebooks, and VS Code. The interface is available at https://dcc-ondemand-01.oit.duke.edu/ (Duke login and account on DCC required).\nData storage: 1 TB free storage per lab, additional storage available for rent. Archival storage is $62 / TB-year without backup and $144 / TB-year with backup. Additional pricing for higher speed storage is at https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0030661.\nFor PIs to manage the users in their account see Research Toolkits (requires Duke netid login).\nFor PIs to request an account on DCC and for additional help and advice on DCC contact OIT (requires Duke MS Outlook).\n\nThe Department of Computer Science also has an HPC cluster that is only available to faculty in that department; see https://cs.duke.edu/resources/computing-resources/faqs.\n\n© 2024 Steven Rozen and Duke University; send corrections and queries to sr110 [at] duke.edu"
